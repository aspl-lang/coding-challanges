# Brainfuck interpreter - 4/5
**Challenge**: Write an interpreter for the "Brainfuck" programming language.
<br>The language is very close to the theoretical concept of a Turing machine and thus extremely low level, but simple to implement.
<br>You can look up the [Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brainfuck) for more information.
