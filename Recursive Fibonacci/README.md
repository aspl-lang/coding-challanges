# Calculating Fibonacci numbers recursively - 1/5
**Challange:** Write a program that calculates the Fiboonacci sequence using a recursive function.
<br>The Fibonacci sequence is a series of numbers where the next number is the sum of the previous two numbers.
<br>A recursive function is a function that calls itself under certain conditions.

**Starting hint**: Use a function that takes 2 fibonacci numbers and returns the next one.
