# Weather API fetcher - 2/5
**Challange:** Write a program that fetches weather data from an API (e.g. OpenWeatherMap) and displays it to the user.
<br>You can build a graphical app or use the command line, although a command line app is probably easier.

**Starting hint**: You can use the `internet` module to fetch data from the internet and the `json` module to parse JSON data.
